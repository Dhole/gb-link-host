# Game Boy Link communication, host side

This is the host side of a project that allows communication between a physical Game Boy Game Link Cable and a computer.

Three functionalities are implemented: 

- Sniffing the serial communication
- Virtual Game Boy Printer that stores the images as PNG files
- Printing directly to the Game Boy Printer (no Game Boy needed)

The code is written in Rust.
